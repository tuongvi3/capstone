<p> There’s a space on the internet that are filled with struggles of growing up with strict Asian parents, language puns, Western teachers not being able to pronounce your
name and depictions of Asians’ obsession with K-pop and boba.These memes capture what it’s like to grow up as a young asian.
Asian memes can be found on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other similar online platforms to seek entertainment by viewing funny memes.

<p> The Cortlandt Street subway station, which was beneath where the Twin Towers stood and was destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, will soon reopen. (The M.T.A. said it was “nearing the finish line” but has not announced further details.)
The L Train shutdown, coming in the spring, is already affecting some New Yorkers more than half a year out — take lease renewals and rentals in Brooklyn, for example. “Some people are moving to the neighborhood looking for a deal,” Ms. Fitzsimmons said, while others are leaving, wondering, “‘Why should I stay here if I won’t even have a good subway stop?’”
And a fare increase, for subways, buses and commuter railroads, is expected to be voted on in January, but whether should happen is up for debate. “It goes up every two years,” Ms. Fitzsimmons said, “but no one can really argue that the service is great right now.” </p>
