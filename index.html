<p> Good morning on this comparatively cooler Friday.
You’re about to read about your commute on your commute.
(Meta.)
We checked in with Emma G. Fitzsimmons, who covers transit for the Metro desk, to see what we should expect from our subways — and those in charge of them — as we head into fall.
The biggest thing to keep an eye on: the “Fast Forward” plan.
Andy Byford, who oversees New York City’s subway system, proposed the daring project to fix our mass-transit turmoil — on which, one year after the “summer of hell,” the needle has barely moved. </p>

<p> Mr. Byford’s plan, projected to cost tens of billions of dollars, would accelerate the rollout of subway improvements over 10 years — in the first half of that decade renovating crumbling stations, updating World War II-era signals and adding new cars; in the second half, everything else.
“It’s a really expensive plan, but almost everyone agrees that it’s what’s needed to actually fix the subway,” Ms. Fitzsimmons told us. “He has identified what needs to be done to fix the system. Now he needs to find the money.”
And that’s a top focus in the governor’s race.

<p> Marcus Molinaro, a Republican contender, has made the problem a priority, as has the Democratic hopeful Cynthia Nixon, who has railed on her rival, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, over the state of our subways and his handling of M.T.A. money.
Congestion pricing, which would charge drivers in the busiest parts of Manhattan, is viewed as a top solution to raise the needed funding, Ms. Fitzsimmons said, but it would require approval from Mr. Cuomo and state lawmakers.
“Most people agree that wherever the money comes from, it’s going to be coming from New York City residents — it would mostly be New York City drivers paying that fee,” she explained. “So the debate over whether it’s the city or state’s responsibility is ongoing.”</p>

A few more transit stories to monitor in the coming months:
The Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, formerly the Tappan Zee, will open its second span on Saturday. (The first opened one year ago.)</p>

<p> The Cortlandt Street subway station, which was beneath where the Twin Towers stood and was destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, will soon reopen. (The M.T.A. said it was “nearing the finish line” but has not announced further details.)
The L Train shutdown, coming in the spring, is already affecting some New Yorkers more than half a year out — take lease renewals and rentals in Brooklyn, for example. “Some people are moving to the neighborhood looking for a deal,” Ms. Fitzsimmons said, while others are leaving, wondering, “‘Why should I stay here if I won’t even have a good subway stop?’”
And a fare increase, for subways, buses and commuter railroads, is expected to be voted on in January, but whether should happen is up for debate. “It goes up every two years,” Ms. Fitzsimmons said, “but no one can really argue that the service is great right now.” </p>
